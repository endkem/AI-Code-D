    "\n",
    "3. What is a variable in Python?\n",
    "Ans. A variable in Python is a named reference to a value kept in the computer's memory. It is used to represent and store data that is accessible within a program and can be changed. Python variables can store a variety of data kinds, including numbers, texts, lists, and more sophisticated objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. What are the data types in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Python has a variety of built-in data types that let you store and work with various types of data. \n",
    "Some of the most popular Python data types are listed below:\n",
    "•\tint: Integer type for whole numbers.\n",
    "•\tfloat: Floating-point type for decimal numbers.\n",
    "•\tstr: String type for textual data.\n",
    "•\tbool: Boolean type for True or False values.\n",
    "•\tlist: Ordered collection of items.\n",

    "•\tNone: Type representing the absence of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do you create a function in Python?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, you can define a function by starting with the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for any parameters, a colon, and an indented block of code. \n",
    "Here is the basic syntax.\n",
    " def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "    # Function body\n",
    "    # Statements and code here\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    # If the function should return a value, there is an optional return statement.\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you use if/else statements in Python?\n",
    "Ans. If and else statements in Python are used for conditional branching, enabling your program to take actions in response to certain circumstances. \n",
    "An if statement in Python has the following general syntax:\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "if num >= 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a list comprehension in Python?\n",
    "Ans. By applying an expression or transformation to each element of an existing iterable, such as a list, string, or range, a list comprehension in Python is a condensed approach to build a new list. One line of code does the work of both iterating over the elements and constructing a new list.\n",
    "Following is a list comprehension's general syntax:\n",
    "new_list = [expression for element in iterable if condition]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the difference between range and xrange in Python 2?\n",
    "Ans. Range() and xrange() are two functions that can be used in Python 2 to generate a series of numbers. The two approaches to generating and managing the sequence primarily differ from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Can you explain the difference between deep and shallow copy in Python?\n",
    "Ans. A shallow copy generates a new object but refers to the same elements as the original, but a deep copy generates a new object with its own copy of the elements. Deep copy generates a completely independent copy, whereas shallow copy generates a new object that shares some or all of its data with the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the \"__init__\" method in Python?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the __init__ method is a specific method that is called automatically when a new instance (object) of a class is created. It is also referred to as the constructor method. The __init__ method's purpose is to initialize the newly generated object by setting its initial state or properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is a decorator in Python?\n",
    "Ans. A decorator in Python is a special construct that enables you to improve or change the behavior of a function or class without altering its source code. Decorators are placed atop the definition of a function or class and identified by the @ symbol and the decorator name.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How do you raise and handle exceptions in Python?\n",
    "Ans. During the execution of a program, Python exceptions are raised if an error or other unusual circumstance occurs. Exceptions give us a means to gracefully deal with mistakes and strange circumstances. The try and except statements are used to handle exceptions when they are raised explicitly using the raise keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. How do you create a module in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Typically consisting of functions, classes, and variables, a module in Python is a file that can be imported and used by other Python programs. A separate Python file containing the appropriate code must be created and saved with the .py extension in order to create a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Tuples and lists are both used in Python to store collections of objects, although they differ significantly from one another in terms of usage, syntax, and mutability. Tuples are immutable and frequently used for fixed collections, whereas lists are mutable and frequently used for dynamic collections. Whether you require the capacity to edit the collection after it is generated will determine whether you should use a list or a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you create a dictionary in Python?\n",
    "Ans. A dictionary is a pre-built data structure in Python that enables key-based storage and retrieval of values. Key-value pairs are separated by colons : and used to define dictionaries in curly braces {}.\n",
    "Example: my_dict = {\"fname\": \"Ahmed\", \"lname\": \"Adnew\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"Alexandria\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. How do you write a for loop in Python?\n",
    "Ans. To iterate through a series of components, such as a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers, you can create a for loop in Python. For each element in the sequence, you can repeatedly execute a collection of statements using the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental syntax for a Python for loop is as follows:\n",
    "for element in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code block to be executed for each element\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" in Python?\n",
    "Ans. The == operator and the is operator have various uses and behave differently in Python:\n",
    "\"==\" contrasts two objects' values.\n",
    "\"is\" compares the identities of two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between a class and an object in Python?\n",
    "Ans. A \"class\" specifies the blueprint or template for constructing objects, but a \"object\" is a specific instance of a \"class\" with its own distinct identity and attribute values. \"Objects\" are formed based on \"classes,\" and while they share the same basic structure that the \"class\" defines, they can have a variety of different behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. How do you sort a list in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Using the sort() method or the sorted() function, you can sort a list in Python. You can sort the items on a list either in ascending order or in descending order using either method.\n",
    "A.\tUse of the sort() method\n",
    "The sort() function is a built-in method that alters the original list by sorting it in-place.\n",
    "By default, the list's elements are rearranged in ascending order.\n",
    "List.sort() is the syntax for the sort() method.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "numbers = [4, 2, 1, 3]\n",
    "numbers.sort()\n",
    "print(numbers)  \n",
    "# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "B.\tUse of the sorted() function\n",
    "The built-in function sorted() returns a new sorted list while keeping the original list unaltered.\n",
    "The components in the new list are by default arranged in ascending order.\n",
    "The sorted() function can be used by using the syntax sorted(list).\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "numbers = [4, 2, 1, 3]\n",
    "sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n",
    "print(sorted_numbers) \n",
    " # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "20.Explain the difference between local and global variable in python?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "•\tLocal variables are defined inside a function or block and are only usable inside that function or block.\n",
    "•\tGlobal variables are defined outside of any function or block and are available throughout the entire program.\n"
